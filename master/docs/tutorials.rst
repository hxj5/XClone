XClone base
============

For getting started, we recommend XClone's tutorial for `TNBC1`_ from 10x Genomics,
and `BCH869`_ from smart-seq2. There are two versions of tutorial: One contains main
3 modules (RDR module, BAF module and Combine module), another one is detailed step-by-step
processing of XClone containing preprocessing, RDR fitting, BAF fitting and exploration on
CNV visualization and the identification of cell clones.

Examples of XClone and steps for reproducible results are provided in **Jupyter Notebook** under `examples`_ folder. 

Please refer to **Tutorials** analyzing `TNBC1`_ and `BCH869`_ datasets.

CNV Visualization
==================

This tutorial shows how to visually explore CNVs results using XClone.
